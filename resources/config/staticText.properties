In the heart of what would later become known as the rubber capital of the world, Seiberling began selling bicycle tires in Akron, Ohio. Incorporating for a capital stock of $100,000 in August of 1898, David Hill became the first Goodyear President after buying and investing $30,000. Despite both Seiberling and Hill\u2019s vigilance, it was Seiberling who sought to brand Goodyear as the ultimate American tire.
